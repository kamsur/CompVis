# Dataset Implementation:

I built a custom PyTorch dataset class called InfantVision.
It takes a subset of images and applies a Gaussian blur depending on the "age" we assign to each image.
The idea is to simulate how infants have blurry vision at a younger age and sharper vision as they grow older.

## How the Blur Works:
    I defined specific blur levels (sigma values) for different age groups. For example:
      Newborns (0-2 months) have maximum blur.
      By 12 months, thereâ€™s no blur at all.
    The dataset applies the blur dynamically while loading the data.

## Handling Transformations:
    I made the code flexible by allowing a toggle (use_transform) to turn the blur on or off. This was useful for testing and makes the dataset reusable.

## Age Assignment:
    I randomly assigned an age (like 0, 2, 4, etc.) to each image in a subset of 100 images. These ages control how much blur each image gets.
